Well, here it is. My first-ever post.

![Baby's First Blog Post](/assets/images/babys_first_blog_post.webp)  
*A hilariously bad stock image, generated by ChatGPT*

Before I begin, I'd like to highlight that all imagery on this site has been generated by ChatGPT. I don't have an artistic bone in my body, so sue me.  
They all have misspelt words, but I'm keeping them because I find it amusing. They are also completely unrealistic, like the fact the baby owns a Mac... I wouldn't be caught dead with a Mac, even if I **could** afford one.

Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, I should probably talk a bit about myself.

I'm an Australian cybersecurity professional, with a keen interest in understanding **how** things work and **why** we do them the way we do. I don't claim to be a super-expert, but I think I have a pretty decent grasp of the subject.  
Over the following [var_post_count](# "err: undefined variable") posts, I intend to share a few things I've picked up that have helped me over the years. Just as context can turn information into intelligence, I firmly believe context can turn knowledge into wisdom. For that reason, I enjoy discussing topics such as:

- [ ] The presumption of compromise.
- [ ] Why perimeter-centric cybersecurity is outdated.
- [ ] The perfect solution fallacy.
- [ ] The perfect attacker fallacy *(It's different from the last one, I promise).*

In addition to context and concepts, I spend a lot of time on threat detection. As an enthusiast of threat hunting and detection engineering, I'm also likely to write posts on:

- [ ] TTPs vs IOCs.
- [ ] Detection Engineering and where to start.
- [ ] Hunt queries vs Detection queries.
- [ ] Analysis and Hunt Techniques - where to start when you're unsure.

I've only ever given presentations in person, typically in front of a whiteboard that ends up looking like a child's crayon drawing on the kitchen wall. I hope to start a YouTube channel at some point but need to find the right technology to effectively transfer my thoughts to the screen.

I hope someone out there gets something out of these posts, but if nothing else -  
    `Hey! Potential employers, look at this - I did a thing`
